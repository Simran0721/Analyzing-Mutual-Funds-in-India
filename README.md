# Mutual Fund Performance Analysis

## Project Objective:
To analyze mutual fund performance in India, compare funds across categories, identify trends, and provide insights to help investors make informed decisions.

## Data Sources & Queries:
- Data Source: A dataset containing information about mutual funds in India, including fund name, category, performance metrics, and historical data.
- Key Queries:
  1. Overall market performance
  2. Top-performing funds by category
  3. Comparison of fund performance over time
  4. Analysis of risk-return trade-offs
  5. Identification of fund-specific characteristics (e.g., investment style, sector focus)

## Power BI Tools:
- Get Data: Import the mutual fund data into Power BI using the appropriate connector.
- Power Query Editor: Clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis.
- Visualizations:
  - Line Charts: To visualize fund performance over time.
  - Donut Chart: To represent the distribution of fund categories.
  - Clustered Column Chart: To compare fund performance across different categories.
  - Ribbon Chart: To visualize the performance of different fund categories over time.
  - Area Chart: To analyze the performance of multiple funds simultaneously.
  - Card: To display key metrics (e.g., average return, standard deviation).
  - Slicers: To filter data based on different criteria (e.g., fund category, time period).
  - Gauge: To visualize fund performance against benchmarks.
  - Treemap: To represent the distribution of funds by category and performance.
  - Filtering: To drill down into specific funds or time periods.
  - Format Pane: To customize the appearance of visualizations.
  - Table: To view detailed fund information.
