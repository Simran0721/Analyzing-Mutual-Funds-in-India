# Mutual Fund Performance Analysis

## Project Objective:
To analyze mutual fund performance in India, compare funds across categories, identify trends, and provide insights to help investors make informed decisions.

## Data Sources & Queries:
- Data Source: A dataset containing information about mutual funds in India, including fund name, category, performance metrics, and historical data.
- Key Queries: 
o	Overall market performance
o	Top-performing funds by category
o	Comparison of fund performance over time
o	Analysis of risk-return trade-offs
o	Identification of fund-specific characteristics (e.g., investment style, sector focus)

## Power BI Tools:
- Get Data: Import the mutual fund data into Power BI using the appropriate connector.
- Power Query Editor: Clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis.
- Visualizations: 
o	Line Charts: To visualize fund performance over time.
o	Donut Chart: To represent the distribution of fund categories.
o	Clustered Column Chart: To compare fund performance across different categories.
o	Ribbon Chart: To visualize the performance of different fund categories over time.
o	Area Chart: To analyze the performance of multiple funds simultaneously.
o	Card: To display key metrics (e.g., average return, standard deviation).
o	Slicers: To filter data based on different criteria (e.g., fund category, time period).
o	Gauge: To visualize fund performance against benchmarks.
o	Treemap: To represent the distribution of funds by category and performance.
o	Filtering: To drill down into specific funds or time periods.
o	Format Pane: To customize the appearance of visualizations.
o	Table: To view detailed fund information.
